It has been really long(almost in `Jan '14` ) since I decided to have a blog. I was so good at procrastination that I pushed working on making a blog for almost 9 months. I used wordpress prior to this blog, but it didnt appeal me much. Lately, I somehow got inspired and started going through jekyll on how to build a blog after a heavy self talk answering what am I doing and what should I do?.

Sooner or later I shall write about how to setup jekyll and make a blog using github pages similar to my blogIn:stuck_out_tongue: If you are really in a hurry, then you can use the wonderful documentation provided by jekyll.

Oh! By the way I :heart: markdown. Its so simple and easy to write. Great that jekyll supports markdown. Who doesn't love emoji :heart_eyes: :sunglasses:

#####What inspired me to get this blog done?

>The best way to get something done is to begin.

which I found on a wall somewhere I dont remember :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I actually wanted to have a place where I can write about tutorials, share my experiences and anything that I find cool and awesome. So, blog is a place where I can do that right? Yes! says my inner voice! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: Hence, I made a blog &amp; assigned a name blogIn(sounds cool isn't it?)

#####Also, you might think, what is this guy gonna write about?

Well, I don't know. May be you might see upcoming posts from different categories ranging from tutorials for various programming languages, web development stuff(like frameworks and techniques), DiY hacks, my experiences of being hacker, comics , :heart:Anime &amp; TV-Series &amp; shows(Yeah! I do watch'em) , politics and what not! Stay tuned! Going to effect the web soon.

#####What is my next post about?

My next post is going to be a tutorial for a microframework which revolutionised my OpenSource contribution for the 2014 summer.

(The One? sounds like character name from Matrix. Haha, you guessed it right)
