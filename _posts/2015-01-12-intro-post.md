It has been an year since I decided to have a blog. I was so good at procrastination that I pushed working on making a blog. I used wordpress prior to this blog, but it didnt appeal me much. Lately, I somehow got inspired and started going through jekyll and this awesome [theme](http://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad) on how to build a blog after a heavy self talk answering what am I doing and what should I do?. Also, I had to setup blogs for my teammates on a project under EPICS. So, blogging became part of routine and I find it fun.

Sooner or later I shall write about how to setup jekyll and make a blog using github pages similar to my blogIn:stuck_out_tongue: If you are really in a hurry, then you can use the wonderful documentation provided by jekyll. Hey! Do you know markdown? :heart:. Its a simple language used to write focused content. Its so simple and easy to write. Great that jekyll supports markdown. And, you already might have noticed the emoticons, who doesn't love emoticons :heart_eyes: :sunglasses:

#####What inspired me to get this blog done?

>The best way to get something done is to begin.

which I found on a wall somewhere I dont remember :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I actually wanted to have a place where I can write about tutorials, share my experiences and anything that I find cool and awesome. So, blog is a place where I can do that right? Yes!. So, I made a blog &amp; assigned a name blogIn(sounds cool isn't it?)

#####Also, you might think, what am I going to blog about?

Well, I don't know. May be you might see upcoming posts from different topics from tutorials for various programming languages, web development stuff(like frameworks and techniques), DiY hacks, my experiences of being hacker, comics , :heart:Anime &amp; TV-Series &amp; shows(Yeah! I do watch'em) , politics and what not! Stay tuned!

#####What is my next post about?

I have been doing projects using python and php frameworks, probably I shall blog about one of them soon.

Thats all for now, stay tuned for more updates.

#####- The One
(Was that pen name kind of thing?(*May be*)The One?(*seriously* :stuck_out_tongue:) sounds like character name from Matrix. Haha, you guessed it right)
